# TomatoEnergy
This is configuration for Home Assistant and Tomato Energy. There's no APIs today but fixed tariffs. Once billed there are CSV's available for you to download from Tomato's "MyWatts" website to compare.

This configuration assumes you have a CT clamp for monitoring power at the electric meter! In my config this is: sensor.modbus_grid_consumption 


Home Assistant Electricity Dashboard
This documentation provides a complete guide for setting up an Electricity Dashboard in Home Assistant. The setup includes sensors, automations, helpers, and a customizable dashboard to monitor electricity usage, costs, and tariffs.

Sensors
1. ModBus Integration Sensor (kWh Calculation)
Convert kW to kWh using the integration platform.

yaml
Copy code
sensor:
  - platform: integration
    source: sensor.modbus_grid_consumption
    name: ModBus GH Grid Consumption kWh
    round: 3
2. Projected Daily Cost Sensor
Calculate the projected cost for the day based on current usage.

yaml
Copy code
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Projected Daily Cost"
        unit_of_measurement: "Â£"
        state: >
          {% set cost = states('sensor.total_electricity_cost') | float %}
          {% set current_hour = now().hour | float %}
          {% if current_hour > 0 %}
            {{ ((cost / current_hour) * 24) | round(2) }}
          {% else %}
            0.00
          {% endif %}
3. Current Electricity Rate Sensor
Dynamically determine the current electricity rate based on tariff times.

yaml
Copy code
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Current Electricity Rate Tomato"
        unique_id: current_electricity_rate_tomato
        unit_of_measurement: "p/kWh"
        state: >
          {% set off_peak_rate = 0.05004 %}
          {% set drop_rate = 0.140427 %}
          {% set peak_rate = 0.243128 %}
          {% set current_time = now().strftime("%H:%M") %}

          {% if "00:00" <= current_time < "06:00" %}
            {{ off_peak_rate }}
          {% elif "09:30" <= current_time < "11:30" %}
            {{ drop_rate }}
          {% elif "22:00" <= current_time < "23:59" %}
            {{ drop_rate }}
          {% else %}
            {{ peak_rate }}
          {% endif %}
Automations
1. Tariff Switching Automation
Automatically updates the tariff based on the current time.

yaml
Copy code
alias: Update Electricity Tariff
trigger:
  - platform: time_pattern
    minutes: "/5"  # Runs every 5 minutes
action:
  - service: utility_meter.select_tariff
    target:
      entity_id: utility_meter.electricity_usage
    data:
      tariff: >
        {% set current_time = now().strftime("%H:%M") %}
        {% if "00:00" <= current_time < "06:00" %}
          off_peak
        {% elif "09:30" <= current_time < "11:30" %}
          drop_rate
        {% elif "22:00" <= current_time < "23:59" %}
          drop_rate
        {% else %}
          peak
        {% endif %}
Helpers
1. Utility Meter Helpers
Track energy usage across different tariffs using sensor.modbus_gh_grid_consumption_kwh as the source.

yaml
Copy code
utility_meter:
  electricity_usage:
    source: sensor.modbus_gh_grid_consumption_kwh
    cycle: daily
    tariffs:
      - off_peak
      - peak
      - drop_rate
Dashboard

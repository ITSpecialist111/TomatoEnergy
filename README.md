***TomatoEnergy Configuration for Home Assistant  - SWITCH TO CODE TAB!!! ***

This repository provides a complete guide to setting up an Electricity Dashboard in Home Assistant for users of Tomato Energy. Since Tomato Energy doesnâ€™t currently offer an API, this configuration enables effective monitoring of electricity tariffs and usage, especially for users with a CT clamp sensor (e.g., sensor.modbus_grid_consumption).

Features
Monitor electricity usage and costs.
Automatically switch tariffs based on time.
Visualize energy consumption with graphs and gauges.
Optimize usage for house batteries, EVs, and large appliances.
Sensors
1. ModBus Integration Sensor (kWh Calculation)
Convert power from kW to kWh using the integration platform.

yaml

sensor:
  - platform: integration
    source: sensor.modbus_grid_consumption
    name: ModBus GH Grid Consumption kWh
    round: 3
2. Projected Daily Cost Sensor
Estimate daily electricity costs based on current usage.

yaml

template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Projected Daily Cost"
        unit_of_measurement: "Â£"
        state: >
          {% set cost = states('sensor.total_electricity_cost') | float %}
          {% set current_hour = now().hour | float %}
          {% if current_hour > 0 %}
            {{ ((cost / current_hour) * 24) | round(2) }}
          {% else %}
            0.00
          {% endif %}
3. Current Electricity Rate Sensor
Automatically determine the current electricity rate based on time.

yaml

template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Current Electricity Rate Tomato"
        unique_id: current_electricity_rate_tomato
        unit_of_measurement: "p/kWh"
        state: >
          {% set off_peak_rate = 0.05004 %}
          {% set drop_rate = 0.140427 %}
          {% set peak_rate = 0.243128 %}
          {% set current_time = now().strftime("%H:%M") %}

          {% if "00:00" <= current_time < "06:00" %}
            {{ off_peak_rate }}
          {% elif "09:30" <= current_time < "11:30" %}
            {{ drop_rate }}
          {% elif "22:00" <= current_time < "23:59" %}
            {{ drop_rate }}
          {% else %}
            {{ peak_rate }}
          {% endif %}

        
***Automations***
1. Tariff Switching Automation
Automatically update the utility meter tariff based on the current time.

yaml

alias: Update Electricity Tariff
trigger:
  - platform: time_pattern
    minutes: "/5"  # Runs every 5 minutes
action:
  - service: utility_meter.select_tariff
    target:
      entity_id: utility_meter.electricity_usage
    data:
      tariff: >
        {% set current_time = now().strftime("%H:%M") %}
        {% if "00:00" <= current_time < "06:00" %}
          off_peak
        {% elif "09:30" <= current_time < "11:30" %}
          drop_rate
        {% elif "22:00" <= current_time < "23:59" %}
          drop_rate
        {% else %}
          peak
        {% endif %}

    
***Helpers***
1. Utility Meter Helpers
Track energy usage across different tariffs using sensor.modbus_gh_grid_consumption_kwh as the source.

yaml

utility_meter:
  electricity_usage:
    source: sensor.modbus_gh_grid_consumption_kwh
    cycle: daily
    tariffs:
      - off_peak
      - peak
      - drop_rate
